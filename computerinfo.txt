Preliminaries
Preliminary Instructions

Check the following elements first:

- That something has been turned in (in the git repo).

- No cheating; the student must be able to explain their code.

- If the program is written in a compilable language, there's a Makefile at least the rules all, re, and clean. If an element of this list is not respected, the grader stops there. Use the appropriate flag. You are encouraged to continue to debate the project, but the rating scale is not applicable.
 Yes
 No
First section
Mandatory Part

Existence of reduced equation

Does the program takes an equation as a parameter on standard
input and show the results in reduced form? Is it correct?
 Yes
 No
Reduced-form equation

In the reduced equation, are the powers are shown until the last non-zero
power, one time, and is one of the two sides of the equation zero?
 Yes
 No
Input handling

Try multiple properly-formatted inputs with potential complexities (coefficient of zero, negative numbers, fractions ...). Does the program handle them? (No crash or calculation errors, no infinite loops...).
IMPORTANT: If you have responded 'no' to one of these three questions, the defense ends here. 
 Yes
 No
Degree 0 (special case 0) Equations

Enter a possible equation (for example, "5 * X^0 = 5 * X^0"). Does the program tell you that all real numbers are the solution? Enter an impossible equation (for example, "4 * X^0 = 8 * X^0"). Does the program tell you that there are no solutions?
 Yes
 No
Degree 1 (Linear) Equations

Enter a linear equation (for example: "5 * X^0 = 4 * X^0 + 7 * X^1"). Does the program show you the solution to the equation? Try a couple different equations.
 Yes
 No
Degree 2 (quadratic) Equations - positive discriminant

Try a quadratic equation with a positive discriminant (for example: "5 * X^0 + 13 * X^1 + 3 * X^2 = 1 * X^0 + 1 * X^1"). Does the program show you that it is has a positive discriminant? Does the program show you two solutions? Are they right? Try a couple of different equations.
 Yes
 No
Degree 2 (quadratic) Equations - discriminant of zero

Enter a Degree 2 (quadratic) equation with a negative discriminant (for example: "5 * X^0 + 3 * X^1 + 3 * X^2 = 1 * X^0 + 0 * X^1"). Does the program show you that the equation has a negative discriminant? Does it show you two complex solutions? Are they right? Try a couple of equations.
 Yes
 No
Equations de degré 2 - Discriminant strictement négatif

Entrez une équation de degré deux avec un discriminant strictement négatif (par exemple: "5 * X^0 + 3 * X^1 + 3 * X^2 = 1 * X^0 + 0 * X^1"). 
Le programme vous affiche bien qu'elle a un discriminant strictement négatif ? 
Le programme vous affiche bien deux solutions complexes? Ce sont les bonnes ? Faites plusieurs essais. 
 Yes
 No
Degree 3+ Equations

Enter an equation of Degree 3 or more. The program should refuse to solve the equation. If the program solves it, award points even so, and make a small gasp of admiration, but in either case, the program can't crash.
 Yes
 No
Bonus
Bonus Part

Handling of naturally formated input

Is the program capable of handling naturally formatted input?
* A coefficient alone ("4") is treated as a factor of X^0.
* An X alone is considered to have a coefficient of 1 and an exponent of 1.
* A missing exponent ("4 * X") is considered to be 1.
* A missing coefficient ("X^6") is considered to be 1.
* Operands can be input in arbitrary order regardless of exponential power; multiple operands of the same power may also appear in arbitrary order.
 Yes
 No
Second bonus

Appropriate handling of input errors (lexical and syntactical).
Displays results as irreducible fractions, when applicable.
Displays intermediate steps.
Etc...
Rate it from 0 (failed) through 5 (excellent)
